                    During the peak of their playlist, many of their videos had once featured user generated commentary under YouTube’s ANNOTATION EDITOR - A COMMONS BASED FEATURE [CHANT], that allowed the application to leverage the market potential of its users, through adaptations to the proprietary content uploaded, collapsing producer and consumer into a vibrating singularity.  Launched in 2008, the function had enabled users to customise their content - coupling their videos to an integrated text box, hyperlink or other ancillary information.

                  "“I remember waking up in the middle of the night one time, and just hearing this loop over and over in my head with the "Hankie" sample so prominent. One of the few tracks that genuinely made me feel uneasy. Credit to the boys for being able to create such an intense atmosphere… definitely not for the faint hearted!” - Sean R 1 year ago" - <cite> Sean.R, 2019, YouTube</cite>

                    Though the visual content of each video was often little more than a static digital image of an album cover or centre label, THEY HANG THEMSELVES ON THE HTTP [CHANT], as the text box appeared, he would close it. In 2017, several years after the beginning of their YouTube playlist, the ‘annotations editor’ would be sunset. “SUNSET?”, SHE EXCLAIMS [CHANT]. “Yes”, because its use had fallen rapidly. The feature would be replaced by a series of standardised widgets and end screens, “AN ENDLESS HORIZON OF SUNSETS?”, SHE EXCLAIMS [CHANT]. “No", an optimal person-centred environment calibrated via a customisable array of thumbnails displayed at the closing of the video or the vertiginous list of scrollable thumbnails to the right of the video… “AN INTERPOLATIVE HABITAT OF TILES?”, SHE EXCLAIMS [CHANT]. “Yes”, and with particular videos earmarked as RECOMMENDED FOR YOU [CHANT], as their magic was marshalled into a slab-hell. Around damp geographies, its features are constantly renewed… videos expunged in cellular lysis to create new digital space, or re-orientated to now appear in the users field of vision, creating effervescent zones of transitional change.

                    When left to itself, it algorithmically moves them both between its parts, self-assembling recommendations  - Hiroshi Yoshimura’s ‘Music for Nine Postcards’, ‘Very old Top Gear - very young Jeremy Clarkson and Tiff’, and ‘Three Tiers of Swedish Meatballs’, three particular ways to prepare meatballs with each tier representing a new level of complexity and challenge to the culinary skills required of the previous tier. Each video functions as the commensal organism for the next, returning to generatively feed on each another, ONE FEEDS THE NEXT, WHO IN TURN, FEEDS ANOTHER AND INHERITS ITS CONSEQUENCES IN FLESH [CHANT], for as long as the computer could allow.
